### Game Title: Skill Fighters (Name is WIP)

### Genre & Target Audience: 

Online Multiplayer Fighting Game/ Teenagers and up

### Overview of Game: 

Simple fighting game where player has access to four skills, including 3 normal skills and an ultimate ability (think Q W E R from League of Legends or Overwatch). Players have a health bar and energy meter that gets filled up during gameplay, allowing them to access their abilities more easily. All skills are on a cooldown ranging from short to long, and the pace of the game is slower to reflect that (also making online play more manageable). We can start with one or two move sets and add more as we get a better understanding of our scope.

### Core Mechanics

● Walking and Jumping(Movement) 

o Character can move forward and back using arrow keys and jump using spacebar. Certain skills may or may not be accessible while jumping.

o Holding down will allow players to crouch, similar to jumping, some attacks will not be usable in this state

o Characters will not be able to leave screen space.

● Attacks and Blocks

o Q attack will have a very short cooldown and can be considered a basic attack

o E and W attacks will be a slightly stronger but more a costly attack in terms of cooldown and cost etc.

o R or the ultimate attack will be very powerful, but could only be accessed once or twice per round on average

o Attacks may have blocking properties, but there is no dedicated block button. Players will have to dodge moves

● Health and Meter

o Each player has a health bar. First to fall to zero health loses.

o Meter bar will have 3 levels. Attacks can have a reduced cooldown by spending meter. The meter bar is filled up when the player gives or receives damage. Some attacks will cost more meter then others.

o UI also includes a timer which limits the length of a match, and a round counter, allowing players to play in sets of best of 3 or 5.
